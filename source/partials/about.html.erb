      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Keita</strong>, a half Japanese🇯🇵 / American🇺🇸 human-being born and raised in 🗼<strong>Tokyo, Japan.</strong></p>
      <p>I started my journey into programming with a C# game development course. After learning the basics and successfully designing and prototyping two games, I enrolled in a full-time coding program at <strong>Le Wagon</strong>. I've been building apps ever since!</p>
      <p>I love watching 🎬movies(Marvel, Edgar Wright, Wes Anderson), collecting 🎶LP records, playing both video/board 👾games. On the left is my toy poodle Lady🍝 and on the right, is my sister's cat Apollo☀️.</p>
