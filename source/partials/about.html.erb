      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Keita</strong>. A half Japanese🇯🇵 / American🇺🇸 human-being born and raised in 🗼<strong>Tokyo, Japan.</strong></p>
      <p>In December 2022, I completed the <strong>Le Wagon Bootcamp</strong> (9-week intensive coding program). Enjoyed working in all of the fields but especially loved frontend development.</p>
      <p>I love watching movies(Marvel, Edgar Wright, Wes Anderson), collecting LP records, playing both video/board games. I own a toy poodle named Lady🍝, named after Lady and the Tramp. Also on the right is a picture of me and my sisters cat Apollo☀️.</p>
